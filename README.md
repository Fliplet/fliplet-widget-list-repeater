## Development

This widget is meant to be used with the Fliplet platform.

Run for local development with the [`fliplet-cli`](https://github.com/Fliplet/fliplet-cli):

You can also manually build the source code with `npm run build`

Then, keep the watcher running and on a new tab run the following command:
